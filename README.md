<p>This is just an normal recommender system I made using python.</p>
<h1>Problem statement</h1>
<p>Every streaming content has its own viewers and each content has it’s rating. Viewers leave some good ratings for the content if they like it. But where does it apply? Viewers can spend hours scrolling through hundreds, sometimes thousands of anime’s never finding an content they like. Business need to be provided suggestions based on their likes and needs in order to create a better streaming environment that boosts revenue and increases the time spent on a website</p>

<h1>What is a recommendation engine ?</h1>
<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*dCEBhlDpuHkwEErkprmG_g.jpeg'> 
<p> It is an unsupervised learning algorithm (one that does not have a target variable to measure accuracy against) mostly used to aid in consumer decision making. I’m sure you have seen them while online shopping. They also appear in places like streaming apps (aka Netflix and Hulu) to help you select a TV show or movie to watch next and on journalism/media websites like Medium to suggest other articles you may like to read, among many other uses. Obviously many e-retailers like Amazon have already been using recommender algorithms for quite some time, but many smaller or newer sites are still in need. There are different varieties of recommenders that base their predictions on different features.</p>

<h1>About the Dataset</h1>
<p>This data set contains information on user preference data from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime. Each user is able to add anime to their completed list and give it a rating and this data set is a compilation of those ratings</p>
